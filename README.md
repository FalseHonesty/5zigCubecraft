This is a plugin for the Minecraft mod [5zig](http://5zig.net/) that adds a few
display items to show a list of chest type votes, your selected kit and the
selected chest type in SkyWars on the [CubeCraftGames Server](https://www.cubecraft.net/).


This is not an official plugin and I am not affiliated with Cubecraft or 5zig.


Building (developers only)
==========================
Download the latest version of the [5zig api jar](https://github.com/5zig/The-5zig-API/releases)
Place the jar file in the `libs` folder of this project.


You can now open the project in an IDE with Gradle support (like _IntelliJ IDEA_).


If you just want to compile a JAR file, open the project directory in
a terminal and execute this command:

Windows:

    gradlew jar

Linux:

    ./gradlew jar
